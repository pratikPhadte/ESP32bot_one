# ESP32 bot with ROS2 and object tracker

Hello all, this is a template taken from Joshnewans(ArticulatedRobotics https://github.com/joshnewans ), I have used this template to create a package of my ESP32 bot which I can simulate on Gazebo and run programs on it using launch files. My main goal is to make a cost-effective robot using ESP32 and ROS that can do some parts of computer vision and SLAM.
