#ESP32 bot with ROS2 and object tracker

Hello all, this is a template taken from Joshnewans(ArticulatedRobotics), I have used this template to create a package of my ESP32 bot which I can simulate on Gazebo and run programs on it using launch files. My main goal is to make a cost-effective robot using ESP32 and ROS that can do some parts of computer vision and SLAM.

Follow along this repo for amazing stuff!

# Robot Package Template

This is a GitHub template. You can make your own copy by clicking the green "Use this template" button.

It is recommended that you keep the repo/package name the same, but if you do change it, ensure you do a "Find all" using your IDE (or the built-in GitHub IDE by hitting the `.` key) and rename all instances of `my_bot` to whatever your project's name is.

Note that each directory currently has at least one file in it to ensure that git tracks the files (and, consequently, that a fresh clone has direcctories present for CMake to find). These example files can be removed if required (and the directories can be removed if `CMakeLists.txt` is adjusted accordingly).
